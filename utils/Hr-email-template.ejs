    <p>Hello HR,</p>

    <p>
        I hope this message finds you well. My name is Dinesh Yadav, and I am a final-year undergraduate at the Indian
        Institute of Information Technology Vadodara International Campus Diu. With a strong foundation in computer
        science and hands-on industry experience, I am eager to explore full-time opportunities at <strong>
            <%= company %>
        </strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a <strong>
            <%= position %>
        </strong>, I bring expertise across the front-end (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Zustand), back-end
        (Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs), and databases (MongoDB, MySQL, Prisma). I also have a strong grounding in
        software engineering principles (OOP, Design Patterns, SOLID, LLD/HLD). Additionally, I have solved 850+ Data
        Structures and Algorithms problems, which has significantly strengthened my problem-solving and analytical
        skills.
    </p>

    <p>I bring hands-on experience from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part-time Software Development Engineer at AeroYantra</strong> (Jun 2025 – Present): Delivered email
            and mobile verification systems, a personalized user dashboard, and public/private content sharing features.

    <p>
        Attached are my resume and portfolio for your review. I would be delighted to contribute my skills to <strong>
            <%= company %>
